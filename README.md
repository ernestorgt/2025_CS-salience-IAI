# Phonetic and Social Salience and the Interval Asymetry Index
This project investigates the production of voiceless stop consonants /p t k/ in Spanish-English code-switching (CS) contexts. The study focuses on the divergent behavior of /t/ relative to /p/ and /k/ across languages, integrating both phonetic and social salience to explain bilingual speech outcomes.

The data come from 60 Spanish-English bilinguals in California who completed four CS speech activities: word list reading, passage reading, puzzle completion (Diapix), and sociolinguistic interviews. Voice onset time (VOT) was the primary acoustic measure, complemented by analyses of stop burst acoustics.

A novel statistical procedure, the Interval Asymmetry Index (IAI), was developed to quantify departures from the expected linear increase in VOT across place of articulation. Analyses revealed systematic divergence of /t/ in both languages, suggesting that this stop occupies a socially and phonetically salient position in bilingual speech.
